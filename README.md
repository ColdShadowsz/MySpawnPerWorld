# MySpawnPerWorld
MySpawnPerWorld was created to fix a long‑standing issue on OneBlock and SkyBlock servers where players dying in Nether or End dimensions were always forced back to the hub by Essentials. This plugin restores proper per‑world respawn behavior and adds personal spawn points for each world. Built and tested on 1.20.6 — CREATED FOR KAIDMC
